# EXPERIMENT 14
# AIM
To study and implement inheritance 
# THEORY
A key concept in object-oriented programming in C++ is inheritance, which enables a class to inherit properties and features from another class. This establishes a hierarchical link between classes and promotes reusing of code.
1. Key Concepts:
* Base Class (Parent Class):
-> The class from which properties and methods are inherited. It is also called the parent or superclass. <BR>
* Derived Class (Child Class):
-> The class that inherits the properties and methods from the base class. It can add new members or modify the inherited ones. <BR>
